#History of jSCSI

jSCSI greatly assisted the research by allowing for easy access to any iSCSI targets starting with the development of an initiator and acted as base for an own jSCSI-target as well. jSCSI thereby represents a platform for multiple thesis within our working group and is maintained continuously since 2007.

##2013

* jSCSI acts as frontend for treetank.org as well as for jclouds.org for allowing the integration of cloud-storage in a secure and scalable way even for the iSCSI-protocol in a cloud-provide independeent way. 

##2012

* jSCSI retrieves the first pull-requests from users utilizing jSCSI. Entirely
The project leaves the infrastructure of the University of Konstanz entirely hosted by Github, guarded by Travis-CI and 
published on sonatype.

##2011

* jSCSI is transferred from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jscsi/) to [github](https://github.com/disy).
The development of a target is concluded as bachelors' project of Andreas Ergenzinger.

##2010

* The development of a target is started.

##2009

* The second iteration (jSCSI 2.0) of the initiator resulted in a technical report accessible under http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-84511.
The initiator was entirely refactored leveraging from the new abilities provided by the Java 5 concurrent API. The result is presented in the bachelors' thesis of Patrice Brend'amour accessible under http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-130096 (german only).

##2008

* A software raid was implemented as bachelors' project of Bastian Lemke similar to the volume managers in linux (LVM) or the one provided by ZFS. The related thesis is accessible under http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-58078 (german only).

##2007

* Developed as the master project of Volker Wildi, a more detailed description of the jSCSI 1.0 (initiator only) is accessible as master thesis under http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-175134.
* The initiator of jSCSI 1.0 was presented at the Jazoon as Work in Progress: The working paper is accessible under http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-84424.

##2006

* jSCSI first was developed as a part of the native XML database system Treetank (formerly known as idefix). Utilized as backend, the jSCSI initiator was taken as backend for a visualization of block-access patterns. The concrete approach was presented at the InfoVis 2006 whereas the paper is accessible under http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-69096.
